Beamed on to a big screen by Nelson's Column from a military bunker in Ukraine, the former world heavyweight boxing champion said: ""We defend right now the same principles. ""Please keep together with our country, keep together with Ukraine."" His call came as London mayor Sadiq Khan said the UK should be doing ""much more"" to help the country's refugees. Mr Khan was among the thousands BRITS SUPPORT UKRAINE Solidarity By Berny Torre that gathered in Hyde Park for a ""London Stands with Ukraine"" march. Speaking before the vigil, the mayor said: ""It is important throughout the next few days, weeks, to make it far, far easier, and much easier for those who are fleeing Ukraine to come here. You compare our Government's actions versus the actions of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, it's embarrassing. ""We've got to be doing much more,"" he added. ""I'm full of admiration for anybody Picture: JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP/Getty Solidarity Ukraine who has the space to provide a room for those who have fled Ukraine. ""It's really important families are not left to their own devices, the Government has to step up and support them."" However, when asked by a Sky News presenter if he would be welcoming a Ukrainian refugee to live with him, Mr Khan said he ""personally won't be"". The Labour politician, who lives in Streatham with his wife and two children, said the decision not to host was down to ""a variety of reasons, those being protection, security and a lack of space""."
